# Problem
* Choose any dataset for multiclass classification on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (go to "Datasets" section, choose "Filter" and enter "multiclass classification" into the "Tags" field). 
* Perform classification with few methods. I expect you to use at least SVM (linear and rbf) and random forest.
* Try getting the best result with each of the methods. I expect you to use at least GridSearch.
* Try feature engineering. I expect you to use at least PCA for dimensionality reduction.
* Calculate accuracy and confusion matrix for each of the methods.
* Do conclusions. Which method is the best? Why? If the dataset has any articles linked, compare your results with the state of the art.

# Grading criteria:
* I expect a confident usage of sklearn methods.
* I expect understanding of basics of models assessment.
* I expect you to be able to learn PCA method on your own.
* I expect the ability of succinct, cohesive, and coherent expression of your thoughts, i.e. clearly state (in a few sentences) what is the problem you are solving, what approaches do you propose, and what conclusions can be done regarding these approaches in the context of the problem.

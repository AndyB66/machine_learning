Q Choose nominal data from the following (recall data types):
✓ name
✘ height represented as “Tall-Medium-Small”
✓ gender
✘ degrees Kelvin
✘ degrees Celsius
✓ language
✘ size represented as “Large-Small”
✘ points of affine space
✘ mass

Q Choose ordinal data from the following (recall data types):
✘ name
✓ height represented as “Tall-Medium-Small”
✘ gender
✘ degrees Kelvin
✘ degrees Celsius
✘ language
✓ size represented as “Large-Small”
✘ points of affine space
✘ mass

Q Mean value can be calculated for which data types?
✘ Nominal
✘ Ordinal
✓ Interval
✓ Ratio

Q Median can be calculated for which data types?
✘ Nominal
✓ Ordinal
✓ Interval
✓ Ratio

Q Which of these are central tendency estimators
✓ Mean
✘ Variance
✓ Mode
✓ Median
✘ STD
✘ Range
✘ IQR

Q If you calculate variance of a sample using equation for population, you’ll get biased result Vb. How do you “unbias” that to get estimator V?
✘ V = Vb -1
✘ V = Vb/(N-1)
✓ V=Vb N/(N-1)
✘ V=Vb (N-1)/N
✘ V = Vb N
✘ There is no way to “fix” the result, only recalculate it with the correct formula

Q You plot your datapoints (2 features) and discover they all lie on a perfect circle that suggests very strong connection between feature 1 and feature 2. If you calclulate a correlation, what result do you expect?
✘ close to 1, as features are highly dependent on each other
✘ close to 1 or -1, as features are highly dependent on each other
✓ close to 0
✘ close to 0.5 or -0.5
✘ can be anything, depends on the exact position of points

Q In MLE, the likelihood function represents:
✓ The probability of the data given the parameters
✘ The probability of the parameters given the data
✘ The probability of the data
✘ The probability of the parameters

Q What is the primary goal of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)?
✘ Minimize the likelihood function 
✓ Maximize the likelihood function 
✘ Minimize the sum of squared errors 
✘ Minimize entropy

Q What is the consequence of having a high-bias model in the bias-variance tradeoff?
✘ Overfitting to the training data
✓ Underfitting the training data
✘ Balancing between underfitting and overfitting
✘ Achieving optimal model performance

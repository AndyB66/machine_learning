# ? lecture
- [X] Discriminitive vs generative models
- [ ] Introduce popular datasets we will work with: Fisher irises, Old Faithful, NIST, faces
- [ ] Add more algorithmic details: computational complexity, etc.
- [ ] Make a table where minimization functions for all of the topics are summarized.
- [ ] Add conclusions at the end of EVERY lecture.
- [X] Make demo style consistent (consider using SNS).

# Introductory lecture
- [ ] Example with non-balanced dataset (terrorist/non-terrorist) is ambiguous, redo

# Python
- [ ] Too much attention to simple types, need more objects/classes

# Numpy lecture
- [ ] add `np.einsum` consideration
- [X] think on some visualization for np.arrays
- [ ] error in image with slicing
- [ ] add list/array memory representation image
- [ ] fix cycle/ufunction time comparison (add comparison with list)

# Statistics lecture
- [ ] add Polya  urn models (Beta distribution etc)

# Bayes lecture
- [ ] Problem with 2 boxes, bead, and pearl. 2 boxes, one contains 1 bead and the other 1 pearl. We don't know where pearl is (50/50). One more pearl is aced into box "B", shuffled, randomply pulled back. Pearl is pulled back. What is the probability to have pearl in "A"? in "B"?

# Regression lecture
- [ ] Add Logistic regression
- [ ] Mention orthogonal distance regression (scipy.odr)
- [ ] Regression (to mean) visualization
- [ ] Workbook, problem with error bars, add slider to change order of the fitting polynomial
- [ ] Workbook, add problem to demonstrate LAD robustness (compared to OLS)
- [X] Set feaures on click in demo

# Optimization lecture
- [X] Coordinate descent (has connections to SVM and E-M algo)
- [X] Use UI from GMM demo to set the initial point
- [ ] Use maximum descent algo to get 2D maximum in a matrix of integers as is done in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&t=37s

# All lectures with demos
- [ ] Pull out not only fitting but classification function as well (from visualization).

# PCA
- [ ] Add visualization as in http://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/
- [ ] Use idea with finding dissimilar image from https://dou.ua/lenta/articles/computer-vision-magic/ 

# Manifold learning
- [X] Visualize surface (do Delaune triangulation and draw as a bunch of triangles)

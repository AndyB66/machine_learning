# Problem:
* Go to <a href="https://zno.testportal.com.ua/opendata">OpenData portal of Independent Final Examination (IFE)</a>
* Download one or more datasets available there
* Analyze the dataset(s). I leave it as an open problem, thus you may perform any type of analysis you want. Few ideas listed below
   - Find the best school based on the dataset(s) (define certain metric and perform anlysis, you should clearly state which metric you use and why)
   - Find out if it's true that city schools pass IFE better than village schools 
   - Find out whether there are any patterns in choosing examination subjects for men and women
   - Any other interesting ideas you come up with

# Grading criteria:
* I expect a confident usage of basic ML tools we study: Python, libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
* I expect the ability of succinct, cohesive, and coherent expression of your thoughts, i.e. clearly state (in a few sentences) what is the problem you are solving and what approach do you propose.

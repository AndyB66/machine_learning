# Problem:
* Go to (<a href="https://zno.testportal.com.ua/opendata">OpenData portal of Independent Final Examination (IFE)</a>)
* Download one or more datasetes available there
* Analyze the dataset(s). I leave it as an open problem, thus you may perform any type of analysis you want. Few ideas listed below
   - Find the best school basing on the dataset(s) (define certain metric and perform anlysis, you should clearly state which metric and wy you use)
   - Check if it's true that city schools pass IFE better than village schools 
   - Check if there are any patterns in choosing examination subjects between men and woman
   - Any other interesting ideas you come up with

# Grading criteria:
* I want to see a confident usage of basic ML tools we study: Python, libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
* I want to see the ability of succinct, cohesive, and coherent expression of your thoughts, i.e. clearly state (in a few sentences) what is the problem you are solving and what approach do you propose.
